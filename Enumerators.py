# Enum (enumerator)
# Used when there are going to be set values used repeatedly and you want to avoid mistyping something.
# Ensures consistency and readability across a codebase

# It is always recommended to use the StrEnum or IntEnum classes, rather than the base Enum class, so its use
# is more explicit and so that you can use the values directly.
# e.g., StatusCodes.OK will insert the literal integer value 200, without having to implement anything beyond the key/value pairs,
# whereas this is not the case if your class is using Enum
